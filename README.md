I wanted to see what the latest hits were over the years, so I wrote this.

Nothing spectacular.



Usage
-----

This allows files to be processed while the initial cull is happening.
Start the process by doing:

    mkdir saves
    python pull.py

When you are curious, run:

    python process.py > stuff.csv



Legal
-----

At the time of writing this, I did not find anything on the site saying 
"legal" or "terms" (for terms of service).  I am taking that this behavior
is encouraged, as the robots.txt contains the following:

    User-agent: *
    Crawl-delay: 5
